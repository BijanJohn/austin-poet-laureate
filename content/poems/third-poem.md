Love is all that is real
it shows up in greetings cards and text messages
hugs, smiles and gathering with delicious food
when asking how to improve
use more love, it is what is true
feeds our soul and heart
the expressions in words, actions and art
part with the ideas of representation
to see the nothing underneath
the sensations of love complete, love supreme
it is always here, now
we are allowed this sublime infinite expanse
this love is an ecstatic dance
Lit is what made the Sufi's whirl in trance
history shows our poets with the same message
embedded in different methods
poured in different drinks
love changes how we think
it grows our capacity to heal
love knows no expectations
needs no confirmation
love is what we feel
it is a miracle
that love is all that is real
