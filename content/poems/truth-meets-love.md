How many kids want to be a buddha when they grow up?

it's destiny to wake up

now what to do with this awake awareness

each of us has a gift

can we give it away and split the difference?

find a way from nothing to significance and back again

my favorite teachings are ones which never end

when a best friend is a pen

it can mend the union of mind to physical

ink and paper to pure potential

to inevitabilities so beautiful

transforming the possible to probable

meditate with a visual and create this

your measure of heaven is a slice of bliss

the pleasure to endeavor the soul to adventure

he couldn't miss

how about this

how would you live if time and money didn't exist

I know a place close by

we can go and gave into each other's eyes

the truth doesn't tell lies

but thinks it knows all the answers

wait till truth meets Love and becomes a dancer
