Nothing more important than life

live like this is your 2nd chance and it's time to dance

rhymes from a Love poet to romance the beat

divinely mastered in a moment that couldn't repeat

I usually start slow, to grow

learning fundamentals beneath my feet

work hard, rinse repeat

keep the vision and mission in the captain's seat

my favorite technology is ancient methodologies

meditating, yoga, fasting and writing

the closest thing to magic is kindness and the written word

more philosophy and art therapy than what's usually heard

building material worth passing on

to next generations, lasting after I'm gone, 

the chapters written in midnight, twilight and dawn

an old blues solemn song

the reed flute told me, all the answers from Rumi

that poetry is a conversation between you and me

we keep opening our hearts softly

the universe listens and continues expanding
