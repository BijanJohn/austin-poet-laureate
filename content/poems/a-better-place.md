We need classes on breathing, meditation, reading and relaxing

breathing to show us the infinite depth

of how our air is connected to each other

how we can get high and control our own nervous system

simply by slowing down, expanding

and feeling every molecule of life

meditation, to show us medicine can be found

simply by stopping, by slowing down, by pausing

the absence of stimulus

or the observation of non action can be one of the most

effective methods of action

sit with children, in meditation together

these are worthwhile practices to heal the world

in our visual / audio world of intense data digestion

where recorded moving pictures are our greatest attraction

reading is critical

it is slow food, slow productivity, slow leisure

we can learn to relax with reading

and even learn to find delight in such pleasure

I have to learn and re-learn how to relax

it takes focus and attention, as busy busyness business rules the day

embody the state of openness

and feel how the world relaxes with you
