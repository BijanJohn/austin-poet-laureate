I want to decorate your mind

with the inner cranial jewelry I've been working on

with the words inspired by your beauty

There are four bulbs in the ceiling fans of my bedroom and office

only one bulb is fully screwed in and utilized

It's amazing how much darkness can be stowed away

with one strong bulb

This has been my philosophy around Love

what if you show up to the dance

but more present, filled with more joy

and excited as a kid's second trip to the ice cream stand

It costs nothing to spread kindness and people remember the acts

they are what stick out

what's novel, perhaps they are the moments of why we are here

Of the many forms of intelligence

of which there are many, emotional intelligence is in my top five

I believe it can fill a room with energy

a perfume of intoxicating Love from a single whiff

I want your warm light more than the intensity

I want to show you the mirror so you can also see how bright you shine

if you need help adjusting your chandelier

give me a call, this is one of my favorite aspects of the heavy troublesome chandelier

they require at least two people, now that's a bright idea
