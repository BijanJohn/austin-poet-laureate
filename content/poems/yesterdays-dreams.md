**Need to record a new video**

**Use Austin Library Pictures + good audio**

I dreamed my next job is to build my hometown of Austin

to become the Violet Crown Jewel Poetry capital of the world

a rich luscious legacy of poetry and performing

Maria's Tacos, Cactus Cafe and South Congress Ruta Maya open mics

history from the international poetry festival and readings at the Bahai temple

in the present, a bridge from the past

in the past a shadow of the future

my next job is to showcase between mediums and artists

calling for submissions, real cash for your really best

those selected celebrated at different libraries

across this diverse city's panorama

funds endowed by the city and library system

in a time of endless chaos, conflict and restricted speech

we still have these spaces for time to serenade each other with our visions

yesterday's dream told me to apply

to become Austin's inaugural Poet Laureate

to build this vision

where poetry helps us live more free
