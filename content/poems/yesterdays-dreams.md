**Need to record a new video**

**Need to edit the poem, this is the most important one**

**Use Austin Library Pictures + good audio**

I dreamed my next job is to build my hometown of Austin

to become the Violet Crown Jewel Poetry capital of the world

a rich luscious legacy of poets performing at Maria's Tacos

to South Congress Ruta Maya open mics

rich history in AIPF (Austin International Poetry Festival) to Expressions at The Bahai Center; www.austinpoetryhistory.com

my hometown has over two dozen open mics through the city

most all friendly to poets, there is no single place, yet

for local artists to find them other than word of mouth

from ear to mouth; austinopenmicpoetry.com

this is the present, a bridge from past poets

to where we are now, to the future

A new showcase of collaboration between mediums and artists

calls for submissions, real cash for your really best

those selected will be celebrated at a different library

across this diverse city's panorama

funds endowed by the city and library system

in a time of endless chaos, conflict and restricted speech

we still have these spaces for time to serenade each other with our visions, yesterday's dream told me to apply to become

Austin's inaugural Austin Poet Laureate

to build this vision, where poetry helps us live more free
