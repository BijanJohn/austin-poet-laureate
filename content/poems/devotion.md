I can think, I can wait, I can fast

I can think, I can wait, I can fast

Do it for the city, for the fam

Do it for the love of poetry, because you can

Do it slowly, to surrender

to remember, to relax like Diazepam

a man has two lives, the second begins,

once he realizes there was only one

memento mori, you are mortal and this life will be done

amori fati, love the fate however it's begun

love over hate, pens over guns

principles and power from the Shogun's tower

broadcast like the Rogan hour

road in on a horse

from the ruggest streets of by any means except force

writing is magic, the closest thing to kindness

tragic it isn't obvious to you, me and us

mighty and epic concede to trust

the only thing holding it together

is slow and unrushed, gusto and flow

making mushy oatmeal lingo

peppered with walnut sized egos

write destiny, write a better past if it sets you free

writing to get ahead of me

the future is repetitions, habits and dailies

the present moment always opens wide as it can

telling the hour glass, not so fast grains of sand

my hobby is picking books off the shelf

something I picked up in the lobby

rock the mic for calories not fame, celebrity or salaries

health and prosperity are my devotion

ten thousand functions, one suchness, waves in the ocean

he can think, he can wait, he can fast

he can think, he can wait, he can fast

do it for the city, for the fam

do it for the love of poetry, because you can

do it slowly, to surrender

to remember who I am

native like the cactus, favorite thing to do is practice

sing the blues through lit candle poetry hype madness

Lost children of the masses understand the pain and pathogen

the cost of being the boss, back again, mapping directions

A main has two lives, the first ends after he comprehends there was only one

my philosophy is the work is never done

pay attention to sensation, resting in relaxation

intuit the groove of what you feel, be moved by what moves you

who knew what we could do with so few

coming through putting lentils in your stew, used to imagine down venues and avenues

What could happen if we pretend

these beginnings have no ends

return and send, artistic render'n,

my main man is a member in, a group of many a good men

Could you spare? an extra courageous act

selfless that's not trying to compare, or keep track

Most of the time, these rhymes roast in the sunshine in the Texas summertime

The host who likes to toast at dinner

fun minds in reckless designs

Who let these cats get back from out of the alleys?

Old school raps of jolly good cheer, breaking new grounds this year

we can think, we can wait, we can fast

we can think, we can wait, we can fast

do it for my city, for my fam

do it for the love of poetry, because we can

do it slowly, surrender

remember who we are
