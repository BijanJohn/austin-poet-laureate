**Finish typing up the lyrics**

I can think, I can wait, I can fast

I can think, I can wait, I can fast

Do it for the city, for the fam

Do it for the love of poetry, because you can

Do it slowly, (pause) to surrender

(pause) to remember to relax like Diazepam

a man, has two lives, the 2nd begins,

to rise in his eyes like the sun, once he realizes there was only one

memento mori, you are mortal and this life will be done

amori fati, love the fate however it's begun

love over hate, above all, a higher principle and power

principled artist, rhythmical rhymes harnessed

the hour is time, worth more than money

the sweet present moment, opens your heart honey

energy to spark, shine bright light even when it's dark, steady

Catch him at open mics, ready, opening the likes of young minds with a smile

veteran emcees practiced in the art mastery of freestyles
self therapy he could teach you if you stayed for a while
play the blues in your own shoes 
before walking miles in someone else
discern, learn the difference between riches and wealth of self

my hobby is picking books off the shelf
something I picked up in the lobby
rock the mic for calories not fame, celebrity or salaries
health and prosperity are my devotion

ten thousand functions, one suchness, waves in the ocean

you can think, you can wait, you can fast

you can think, you can wait, you can fast

I do it for my city, for my fam

I do it for the love of poetry, because I can

I do it slowly,(pause) to surrender

(pause) to remember who I am

I'm native like the cactus, favorite thing to do is practice

sing the blues, through lit candle poetry hype madness

Lost children of the masses understand the pain and pathogen

the cost of being the boss, back again, mapping directions

A main has 2 lives, the first ends after he comprehends there was only one

my philosophy is the work is never done

pay attention to sensation, resting in relaxation

intuit the groove of what you feel, be moved by what moves you

who knew what we could do with so few

coming through putting lentils in your stew, used to imagine down venues and avenues

What could happen if we pretend

these beginnings have no ends

return and send, artistic render'n,

my main man is a member in, a group of many a good men

Could you spare? an extra courageous act

selfless that's not trying to compare, or keep track

Most of the time, my rhymes roast in the sunshine in the Texas summertime

The host who likes to toast at dinner

fun minds in reckless designs

Who let these cats get back from out of the alleys?

Old school raps of jolly good cheer, breaking new grounds this year

we can think, we can wait, we can fast

we can think, we can wait, we can fast

I do it for my city, for my fam

I do it for the love of poetry, because I can

I do it slowly, (pause) to remember

(pause)  to surrender who I am
