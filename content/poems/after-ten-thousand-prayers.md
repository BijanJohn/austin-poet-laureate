I began to believe in myself, in others

in the sacredness of this moment,

in something greater than myself

in not needing to know the answers

the process, if and when a breakthrough

would cut through mendacity and the immobile

dogmatism of our apathetic age

after 10,000 prayers, spiritual mastery

began it's apprenticeship

the profane has it's space in the irreducible

practicality knows repetition

remembers how this all works

idealism thinks it will happen sooner than later

after 10,000 prayers I learned how to Love

you more fully, more completely

robust and illustrious Love

than is connected in kinship of universal understanding

we tied knots with string around little pieces of fabric

with a tobacco pouch

we placed attention and intention into each breath

we watered the reed flute of our soul

continue prayers, after 10,000 prayers
